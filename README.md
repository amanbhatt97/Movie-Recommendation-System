## Description

The **Movie Recommendation System** is implemented as a Streamlit web application. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit: Interactive web application framework
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model loading
- Pandas: Data manipulation library
- Joblib: For loading the pre-trained model
- Git: Version control and collaboration

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/amanbhatt97/Movie-Recommendation-System
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`: pip install -r requirements.txt

 ## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
2. Use the dropdowns to select movies or type in the movie name.
3. Click the "Show Recommendations" button to view the movie recommendations.
