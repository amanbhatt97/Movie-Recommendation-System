## Description

The **Movie Recommendation System** is implemented as a Streamlit web application. It uses a powerful algorithm known as **cosine similarity** to analyze the relationships between movies. By comparing key attributes and features of movies in our database, we can identify similarities and recommend films that are likely to resonate with your tastes.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit: Interactive web application framework
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model loading
- Pandas: Data manipulation library
- Joblib: For loading the pre-trained model
- Git: Version control and collaboration

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/amanbhatt97/Movie-Recommendation-System`
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`: pip install -r requirements.txt

 ## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
2. Use the dropdowns to select movies or type in the movie name.
3. Click the "Show Recommendations" button to view the movie recommendations.
